      <p>
        Most people use a VPN with a <strong>shared IP address</strong>. Hundreds of users appear online as the same
        IP, which makes tracking harder and boosts anonymity. A <strong>dedicated IP VPN</strong> flips this idea:
        you still connect through an encrypted tunnel, but the public IP you use on the internet is yours only.
      </p>

      <section class="note">
        <strong>Quick answer:</strong> a dedicated IP is useful when you need
        <strong>stability and reputation</strong> (online banking, business tools, admin panels, remote work),
        but it is <strong>less anonymous</strong> than a shared VPN IP. Think of it as a “clean digital number plate”
        that still sits behind encryption.

        In this guide we will compare shared vs dedicated VPN IPs, look at real-world scenarios
        (remote work, streaming, online banking) and help you decide whether a static address fits your threat model.
        If you are new to VPNs in general, it is worth skimming
        <a href="/en-gb/blog/what-is-a-vpn-uk.html">what is a VPN?</a> first.
      </p>

      <h2>How a VPN with dedicated IP actually works</h2>
      <p class="note">
        <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> technically, a dedicated IP is just another VPN server – but one that
        <strong>does not rotate users</strong>. All requests from that IP can be linked to the same account,
        even though the traffic is still encrypted.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a standard VPN subscription, every time you click “connect”, the app picks a server from a pool and assigns you
        a shared IP. Tomorrow the same IP may be used by someone else. This rotation is great for privacy, but not for systems
        that expect you to show up from the same address every single time.
      </p>
      <p>
        A dedicated IP solves this by reserving one IP address for your account. Under the hood you usually still use the same
        <strong>VPN protocols</strong> as any other server – OpenVPN, IKEv2 or modern options like WireGuard / NordLynx
        that give you low latency. The difference is purely in the way the provider routes and tracks that public IP.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your main concern is bypassing geo-blocks for entertainment, a good shared IP pool combined with the right
        <a href="/en-gb/blog/vpn-protocols-uk.html">VPN protocol</a> is often enough. Dedicated IPs shine more in
        “serious” contexts like work, servers and sensitive accounts.
      </p>

      <h2>When a dedicated IP makes your life easier</h2>
      <p class="note">
        <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> dedicated IPs are about <strong>friction reduction</strong> —
        fewer log-in challenges, fewer blocked sessions, fewer “is this really you?” emails.
      </p>

      <p>Typical situations where a static VPN address helps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Corporate VPN and remote work.</strong> Many companies whitelist employees’ IPs in firewalls, CRMs or SSH
          gateways. With a dedicated IP, you can keep using your own VPN provider instead of the company’s slow gateway.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Admin panels and servers.</strong> Hosting dashboards, cPanel, WordPress admin or database tools often
          restrict access by IP. Using a dedicated IP gives you a stable, encrypted way in without exposing your home IP.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Online banking and PayPal-style services.</strong> A random shared IP in another country can trigger
          fraud checks. A clean, consistent IP has a better chance of passing automated risk scoring, especially when you
          often log in while travelling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Running small services from home.</strong> If you host a tiny mail or game server and route traffic
          through a dedicated IP, firewall rules and DNS records become much easier to manage.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Dedicated IPs also pair nicely with features like <strong>Multi-Factor Authentication</strong>.
        If you are tightening security for business accounts, read our guide on
        <a href="/en-gb/blog/vpn-2fa-mfa-uk.html">VPN and 2FA / MFA</a> as the next step.
      </p>

      <h2>Privacy trade-offs and when you should avoid a dedicated IP</h2>
      <p class="note">
        <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> if your main goal is <strong>maximum anonymity</strong>, a dedicated IP is not
        the right tool. Choose shared IPs, strong encryption and a strict no-logs policy instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        A dedicated IP does not suddenly make you unsafe, but it changes who can link what together. Your VPN provider
        always has to know which account owns which IP. Reputable services run on <strong>RAM-only infrastructure</strong>,
        minimize logs and undergo audits – but you are still reducing the “crowd” effect compared with a shared address.
      </p>
      <p>
        For activities where you are extremely sensitive about being profiled, a classic shared server with good
        <a href="/en-gb/blog/no-logs-vpn-uk.html">no-logs policy</a> is still the better choice. Dedicated IPs are not
        designed for whistle-blowing or avoiding targeted surveillance; they are about reliability.
      </p>

      <p>
        As always, your personal threat model is what matters. For everyday tasks like banking, streaming and remote work
        from the UK, a dedicated IP is usually a practical choice – especially combined with good
        <a href="/en-gb/blog/wifi-security-uk.html">Wi-Fi security</a> and strong passwords.
      </p>

      <h2>Dedicated IP for streaming and geo-blocks</h2>
      <p class="note">
        <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> some people buy a dedicated IP hoping it will magically unblock every platform.
        In reality, success still depends on the <strong>VPN’s streaming strategy</strong>, not just on the fact that
        the IP is static.

        Services like Netflix, BBC iPlayer or DAZN look at many signals: IP reputation, location, previous abuse,
        and how many accounts stream at once from the same address. A dedicated IP can sometimes look “more human”
        than a heavily shared IP, which may help with reliability. But there is no guarantee.

        Make sure your provider has specialised streaming servers in addition to any dedicated-IP option.

      <h2>Security checklist before buying a dedicated IP</h2>
      <p class="note">
        <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> treat a dedicated IP like a powerful tool. Before you pay for it, make sure the
        base service is solid: protocols, encryption, audits and support.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Check the privacy policy and audits.</strong>
          Look for independent security audits and a clear
          <a href="/en-gb/blog/no-logs-vpn-uk.html">no-logs statement</a>. The whole point of a dedicated IP is lost
          if the provider logs full traffic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Confirm which protocols are supported.</strong>
          Ideally you want WireGuard or NordLynx for speed, plus OpenVPN as a fallback for restrictive networks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enable kill switch and DNS leak protection.</strong>
          Use them together with our
          <a href="/en-gb/blog/vpn-dns-leak-uk.html">DNS leak tests</a> to ensure there are no surprises.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Decide where your dedicated IP should live.</strong>
          A UK address is often best for local <a href="/en-gb/blog/vpn-banking-online-uk.html">online banking</a>,
          while a different country might suit global services.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Combine with strong account security.</strong>
          Use password managers, strong passphrases and 2FA on critical logins. A stable IP is not a replacement
          for good hygiene.
        </li>
      </ol>

        <h2>So, should you switch to a dedicated IP VPN?</h2>
        <p>
          If your daily problems are endless security challenges, blocked logins and fragile remote-work tunnels,
          a dedicated IP can be a surprisingly simple fix. If your main goal is to disappear in the crowd, stick to
          shared servers instead.

        <h2>Dedicated IP VPN — FAQ</h2>

        <details>
          <summary>Is a dedicated IP address anonymous?</summary>
          <p>
            Not in the same way as a shared VPN IP. With a dedicated IP, every connection from that address belongs to
            your account, even though the traffic is still encrypted. It is a compromise between convenience and privacy.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Can I use one dedicated IP on several devices?</summary>
          <p>
            Yes. Most VPN providers allow you to connect multiple devices – laptop, phone, desktop – to the same dedicated IP,
            as long as you respect their normal simultaneous-connection limits.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Is a dedicated IP better for remote work?</summary>
          <p>
            In many cases, yes. It makes IP whitelisting easier, reduces login challenges and helps keep long-running
            tunnels to admin panels or internal systems stable.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Does a dedicated IP help with online banking and streaming?</summary>
          <p>
            It can reduce security alerts and some false positives, because you appear from the same address every time.
            However, access still depends on each bank’s and streaming service’s own VPN policy.
