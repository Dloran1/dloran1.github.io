    <!-- CONTENT_START -->
    <p>Using a VPN is a reliable way to enhance your online privacy by encrypting your internet traffic and masking your IP address. However, even the best VPNs can suffer from DNS leaks, which undermine your anonymity by exposing your DNS queries to your internet service provider (ISP) or other third parties. Understanding how DNS leaks happen and how to detect and fix them is essential to maintaining your privacy in 2026.</p>

    <p>DNS leaks are often overlooked but can reveal more about your browsing habits than you might realise. Whether you’re streaming geo-blocked content or simply browsing securely, it’s worth ensuring your VPN is properly configured to prevent these leaks. This guide covers the essentials of DNS leaks, how to test for them, and practical fixes across different platforms.</p>

    <h2>Quick answer</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A DNS leak occurs when your DNS queries bypass the VPN tunnel and are sent to your ISP or other DNS servers, exposing your browsing activity.</li>
      <li>Leaks often happen due to improper VPN configuration, IPv6 traffic, or WebRTC vulnerabilities in browsers.</li>
      <li>Testing for leaks involves specialised websites that check DNS, IPv6, and WebRTC information.</li>
      <li>Fixes vary by platform but generally include disabling IPv6, changing DNS settings, and using VPN kill switches.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When does a DNS leak happen?</h2>
    <p>DNS leaks typically occur when your device sends DNS requests outside the encrypted VPN tunnel. This can happen if your VPN client does not properly route DNS queries through its own secure servers or if your operating system defaults to using ISP DNS servers. Additionally, IPv6 traffic and browser features like WebRTC can cause leaks, even if your VPN is connected. The key takeaway is that a VPN connection alone does not guarantee DNS privacy unless the VPN and device are configured correctly.</p>

    <h2>Limitations and edge cases</h2>
    <p>While most VPN providers strive to prevent DNS leaks, some limitations remain. For example, IPv6 support is inconsistent across VPN services, and many still only handle IPv4 traffic properly. Edge cases include split tunnelling configurations and certain network environments where VPN clients struggle to enforce DNS routing. Also, some free or less reputable VPNs may not prioritise leak protection, increasing risk. It’s important to remain realistic: no VPN can promise perfect anonymity, but understanding these limitations helps manage expectations and improve privacy.</p>

    <h2>How to test DNS/IPv6/WebRTC leaks</h2>
    <p>Testing for leaks is a crucial step in verifying your VPN’s effectiveness. Several online tools allow you to check if your DNS queries, IPv6 traffic, or WebRTC IP addresses are exposed.</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Test Type</th>
          <th>Recommended Website</th>
          <th>What It Checks</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>DNS Leak</td>
          <td><a href="https://www.dnsleaktest.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dnsleaktest.com</a></td>
          <td>Shows which DNS servers your device is using and if they match the VPN’s DNS servers.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>IPv6 Leak</td>
          <td><a href="https://ipleak.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ipleak.net</a></td>
          <td>Checks whether your IPv6 address is visible outside the VPN tunnel.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>WebRTC Leak</td>
          <td><a href="https://browserleaks.com/webrtc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">browserleaks.com/webrtc</a></td>
          <td>Detects if your real IP can be exposed through WebRTC in your browser.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Regularly testing for DNS, IPv6, and WebRTC leaks helps you identify vulnerabilities in your VPN setup and ensures your privacy remains intact.</p>

    <h2>Fixes by platform</h2>

    <h3>Windows</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Disable IPv6: Go to Network &amp; Internet settings &gt; Change adapter options &gt; Right-click your VPN adapter &gt; Properties &gt; Uncheck Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6).</li>
      <li>Manually set DNS servers: Use your VPN’s recommended DNS or a privacy-focused DNS like Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) or Google DNS (8.8.8.8).</li>
      <li>Enable the VPN kill switch if available to block internet traffic if the VPN drops.</li>
      <li>Disable WebRTC in browsers by using extensions or browser settings (e.g., Firefox’s privacy.resistFingerprinting setting).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>macOS</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Turn off IPv6 in System Preferences &gt; Network &gt; Advanced &gt; TCP/IP &gt; Configure IPv6 &gt; Off or Link-local only.</li>
      <li>Configure DNS servers manually to use VPN DNS or trusted third-party DNS.</li>
      <li>Use VPN apps that integrate kill switches and leak protection.</li>
      <li>Disable WebRTC in Safari or use privacy-focused browsers such as Firefox with appropriate extensions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Android</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use VPN apps with built-in DNS leak protection and kill switches.</li>
      <li>Disable IPv6 if your VPN doesn’t support it or your device allows it (varies by Android version).</li>
      <li>Manually configure private DNS in Settings &gt; Network &gt; Private DNS (use a secure provider).</li>
      <li>Use browsers that allow disabling WebRTC or install apps designed to block WebRTC leaks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>iOS</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose VPN apps with DNS leak protection and kill switches.</li>
      <li>Disable IPv6 by configuring VPN profiles that do not route IPv6 traffic.</li>
      <li>Set DNS via VPN app settings or use system-level DNS overrides where possible.</li>
      <li>Use Safari’s privacy features and consider browsers with WebRTC leak protection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Router</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Flash compatible router firmware (e.g., OpenWRT, DD-WRT) that supports VPN client functionality.</li>
      <li>Disable IPv6 or configure it to route through the VPN tunnel.</li>
      <li>Set DNS servers on the router to your VPN provider’s DNS or trusted third-party DNS.</li>
      <li>Enable firewall rules to block DNS requests outside the VPN tunnel.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Troubleshooting checklist</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Verify your VPN is connected and the server location matches your intended region.</li>
      <li>Run DNS leak tests on multiple websites to confirm no DNS requests leak.</li>
      <li>Check for IPv6 leaks and disable IPv6 if your VPN does not support it.</li>
      <li>Test WebRTC leaks in your browser and apply browser-specific fixes if necessary.</li>
      <li>Ensure your VPN client has the latest updates and leak protection features enabled.</li>
      <li>Manually configure DNS servers if your VPN’s DNS leaks or is slow.</li>
      <li>Enable and test your VPN kill switch to prevent traffic leaks if the VPN drops.</li>
      <li>Restart your device and router to clear any cached DNS settings.</li>
      <li>Consider switching VPN protocols if leaks persist (e.g., OpenVPN to WireGuard).</li>
      <li>Review your firewall or security software settings to ensure they don’t interfere with VPN routing.</li>
      <li>Consult your VPN provider’s support or knowledge base for platform-specific instructions.</li>
      <li>Test your VPN on other devices to isolate if the leak is device-specific.</li>
    </ol>
