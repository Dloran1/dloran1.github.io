      <h2>Quick answer: yes, a VPN works with Apple TV — but not always directly</h2>
      <p>Apple TV is designed for streaming, not for tinkering with network settings. That’s why using a VPN on it is slightly less straightforward than on a laptop or phone.</p>
      <p>In 2025 there are basically two worlds:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Newer Apple TVs with tvOS 17+</strong> — they support native VPN apps. You install NordVPN or another provider from the App Store, sign in and connect. [oai_citation:0‡TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/vpn/apple-tv-vpn?utm_source=chatgpt.com)</li>
        <li><strong>Older Apple TVs</strong> — they do not support VPN apps, so you need another method: SmartDNS or a VPN on your router / Wi-Fi hotspot.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In both cases the goal is the same: make your Apple TV connect from a VPN server location so that services like Netflix or Disney+ see you as if you were at home, even when you are abroad. If you’re not sure what a VPN actually does on the network level, you can first skim our guide <a href="/en-gb/blog/what-is-a-vpn-uk.html">what is a VPN and how it works</a>.</p>

      <h2>Recommended combo for Apple TV in 2025</h2>
      <p>For Apple TV you want a VPN with excellent 4K streaming performance, SmartDNS support and native tvOS apps for newer models. In our tests, NordVPN and Surfshark tick all those boxes.</p>

      <h2>Option 1: install a VPN app directly on Apple TV (tvOS 17+)</h2>
      <p>If you own a recent Apple TV 4K with <strong>tvOS 17 or later</strong>, Apple finally allows VPN apps. This is the cleanest setup:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the <strong>App Store</strong> on your Apple TV.</li>
        <li>Search for your provider (for example “NordVPN” or “Surfshark”).</li>
        <li>Download the app, launch it and log in with your account.</li>
        <li>Grant any requested permissions and choose a server location.</li>
        <li>Connect and then launch your streaming apps as usual.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>From there, the VPN behaves almost like on an iPhone. You can quickly switch countries when a particular service (e.g. Disney+ or BBC iPlayer) works better from one region than another.</p>
      <p>For daily use, pick a nearby server for maximum speed and only switch to more distant locations when you specifically need another library.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Option 2: SmartDNS — easiest method for older Apple TVs</h2>
      <p>If your Apple TV model doesn’t support VPN apps, <strong>SmartDNS</strong> is usually the most convenient option. Most premium VPNs include it at no extra cost.</p>
      <p>Instead of encrypting all your traffic, SmartDNS changes how your Apple TV resolves the domains of streaming services. Requests for Netflix, Hulu or BBC iPlayer go via special DNS servers that make the service think you are in a supported region.</p>
      <p>Typical setup looks like this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Log in to your VPN account in a browser and activate <strong>SmartDNS</strong> for your IP address.</li>
        <li>On the Apple TV, go to <em>Settings → Network → Wi-Fi → Configure DNS → Manual</em>.</li>
        <li>Enter the DNS addresses provided by your VPN.</li>
        <li>Restart Apple TV and test a streaming app.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The upside is simplicity and good speed — there is no encryption overhead. The downside is that <strong>only supported streaming traffic is “rerouted”</strong>. For full privacy and encryption, you still need a classic VPN running somewhere on your network.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Option 3: run the VPN on your router or hotspot</h2>
      <p>The most universal solution is to install the VPN on your <strong>router</strong>. Every device that connects to that Wi-Fi, including Apple TV, automatically uses the VPN tunnel.</p>
      <p>There are three common ways to do this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Install the VPN app on a supported router (Asus, GL.iNet and others).</li>
        <li>Use a router firmware that supports VPN clients (for example, some OEM firmware or third-party ones where allowed).</li>
        <li>Share a VPN-protected hotspot from your laptop or PC to the Apple TV.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This method gives you full encryption and one central place to manage your connection. If you want a step-by-step starting point, look at our router guide later: <a href="/en-gb/blog/vpn-router-setup-uk.html">how to set up a VPN on a router</a>.</p>
      <p>The main trade-off is complexity: mis-configured firmware can cause slowdowns for every device on your network. For many people SmartDNS or the native tvOS app is enough, and the router solution is reserved for power users.</p>

      <h2>Video: using a VPN on smart TVs</h2>
      <p>This short video from NordVPN (in English) walks through the main options for running a VPN on smart TVs, including using a hotspot and SmartDNS. The steps are very similar for Apple TV.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Choosing locations and avoiding common streaming issues</h2>
      <p>Even with a good VPN you can still hit error messages like “proxy/VPN detected”. That usually means the provider’s IP ranges are temporarily blocked by a particular platform. A few tips:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Try several servers in the same country.</strong> For example, if Netflix UK refuses one London server, another may still work.</li>
        <li><strong>Use dedicated “streaming” servers</strong> if your provider labels them as such.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear app cache or log out and back in</strong> from the streaming service after changing countries.</li>
        <li><strong>Remember geo-rights.</strong> Some services simply don’t offer the same content everywhere. Our guide on <a href="/en-gb/blog/vpn-geo-blocks-uk.html">VPNs and geo-blocks</a> goes deeper into this.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As a rule of thumb, stick to one or two stable “favourites” for everyday use and only experiment when something really refuses to play.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Speed, 4K streaming and data limits</h2>
      <p>Apple TV is often used on big 4K screens, so speed matters. A few practical points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a wired Ethernet connection</strong> for the Apple TV whenever possible — this reduces packet loss and jitter.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose modern protocols</strong> such as NordLynx or WireGuard-based options rather than older ones like OpenVPN where you have a choice.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch your ISP data caps.</strong> 4K streaming over a VPN can easily consume dozens of gigabytes in an evening.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid double VPN for streaming.</strong> It’s great for privacy, but overkill for Netflix on the sofa; you’ll just lose speed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you notice that only Apple TV is buffering while your phone on the same Wi-Fi plays fine, check that no background downloads or updates are running and that the VPN app (or router) is not overloaded with too many connected devices.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Privacy considerations: VPN is not only about libraries</h2>
      <p>Most people think about a VPN on Apple TV purely in terms of content access, but there is a privacy angle too. Your ISP and local Wi-Fi operator can still see which services you connect to when you stream without a VPN.</p>
      <p>With the VPN running on Apple TV or router:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>your <strong>ISP only sees encrypted traffic to the VPN server</strong>, not which shows you watch;</li>
        <li>public Wi-Fi networks cannot snoop on your DNS requests or inject extra ads into your stream;</li>
        <li>your home IP address is not directly exposed to every service you use.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For detailed privacy pros and cons of VPNs in general, you can compare them with our <a href="/en-gb/blog/free-vs-paid-vpn-uk.html">free vs paid VPN guide</a> later.</p>

    <section class="cta">
      <h2>Next steps: set up your Apple TV VPN once, then just enjoy the shows</h2>
      <p>The good news is that configuring a VPN for Apple TV is mostly a one-time effort. Once your tvOS app, SmartDNS or router is in place, everyday use is as simple as “connect and start watching”.</p>

      <h2>FAQ: VPN and Apple TV</h2>

      <h3>Can I use the same VPN account on Apple TV and my phone?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Most providers allow at least five simultaneous connections, often more. You can protect your Apple TV, phone, laptop and tablet at the same time under a single subscription.</p>

      <h3>Will a VPN on Apple TV change my recommendations?</h3>
      <p>Yes, streaming apps tailor recommendations to the region you appear to be in. If you connect to a US server, you’ll see more American content. When you want your usual UK recommendations back, simply switch back to a UK server.</p>

      <h3>Does a VPN remove ads in streaming apps?</h3>
      <p>No. A VPN may hide your IP address and location, but it does not magically remove in-app adverts or sponsorships. Some providers include separate ad-blocking features, but those work mainly on websites, not inside paid streaming apps.</p>

      <h3>What if my Apple TV updates and the VPN stops working?</h3>
      <p>Occasionally a tvOS update can reset DNS settings or cause an app to misbehave. If something breaks, first reboot the device, then check your VPN provider’s support page for known issues and re-apply SmartDNS or reinstall the app if needed.</p>
